*Are you ready for the show?* RoxStar is a `/client/` and `/server/` implementation of an abandonware API, written in NodeJS. The client is a minimal Electron application that has Flash support enabled, and the server runs through Express, Mustache, and Sqlite3. **By using, copying, or modifying this software you are agreeing to the terms laid out below.** This is a love letter to the game that shaped many childhoods across the world.

## Code Structure üíé
- `/features/` hosts reusable helper functions for various tasks (ex. getting a user's level)
- `/middleware/` hosts the stack that processes requests to the server (ex. routing requests or parsing data)
- `/requests/` hosts all the endpoints that the game calls (ex. when a user buys an item)
- `/server/` hosts internal server-related functions (ex. database, cache, or session management)
- `/utils/` contains random helper functions unrelated to anything in specific (ex. logging)
- `/web/` hosts templates that are dynamically served and injected (ex. login page)
